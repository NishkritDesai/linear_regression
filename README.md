# Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

----
## What it does...
This was just a fun experiment to use **Gradient Descent** to perform linear regression. Linear regression is all about finding the *line of best fit* of all given data points.

----
## Usage

    python linear_reg.py

To run the linear regression program

    python plot_points.py

To plot the points and the "Line of best fit".
----
## Output

![Graph](linear_regression/graph.png?raw=true)

This is the plot of the 'Line of Best Fit' and the data point.Since the data points are *so* scattered
The line really doesn't help get a really good prediction.
* The data points are that of internet usage per minute

## Footnote

The author has also included another dataset for you to try out that shows CO2 concentration
in the atmosphere.
